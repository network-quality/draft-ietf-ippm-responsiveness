                Responsiveness under Working Conditions
                  draft-cpaasch-ippm-responsiveness-01

Abstract

   For many years, a lack of responsiveness, variously called lag,
   latency, or bufferbloat, has been recognized as an unfortunate, but
   common symptom in today's networks.  Even after a decade of work on
   standardizing technical solutions, it remains a common problem for
   the end users.

   Everyone "knows" that it is "normal" for a video conference to have
   problems when somebody else at home is watching a 4K movie or
   uploading photos from their phone.  However, there is no technical
   reason for this to be the case.  In fact, various queue management
   solutions (fq_codel, cake, PIE) have solved the problem for tens of
   thousands of people.

   Our networks remain unresponsive, not from a lack of technical
   solutions, but rather a lack of awareness of the problem.  We believe
   that creating a tool whose measurement matches people's every day
   experience will create the necessary awareness, and result in a
   demand for products that solve the problem.

   This document specifies the "RPM Test" for measuring responsiveness.
   It uses common protocols and mechanisms to measure user experience
   especially when the network is fully loaded ("responsiveness under
   working conditions".)  The measurement is expressed as "Round-trips
   Per Minute" (RPM) and should be included with throughput (up and
   down) and idle latency as critical indicators of network quality.

1.  Introduction

   For many years, a lack of responsiveness, variously called lag,
   latency, or bufferbloat, has been recognized as an unfortunate, but
   common symptom in today's networks [Bufferbloat].  Solutions like
   fq_codel [RFC8290] or PIE [RFC8033] have been standardized and are to
   some extent widely implemented.  Nevertheless, people still suffer
   from bufferbloat.

   Although significant, the impact on user experience can be transitory
   - that is, its effect is not always present.  Whenever a network is
   actively being used at its full capacity, buffers can fill up and
   create latency for traffic.  The duration of those full buffers may
   be brief: a medium-sized file transfer, like an email attachment or
   uploading photos, can create bursts of latency spikes.  An example of
   this is lag occurring during a videoconference, where a connection is
   briefly shown as unstable.

   These short-lived disruptions make it hard to narrow down the cause.
   We believe that it is necessary to create a standardized way to
   measure and express responsiveness.

   Existing network measurement tools could incorporate a responsiveness
   measurement into their set of metrics.  Doing so would also raise the
   awareness of the problem and make the standard "network quality
   measures" of throughput, idle latency, and responsiveness.

1.1.  Terminology

   A word about the term "bufferbloat" - the undesirable latency that
   comes from a router or other network equipment buffering too much
   data.  This document uses the term as a general description of bad
   latency, using more precise wording where warranted.

   "Latency" is a poor measure of responsiveness, since it can be hard
   for the general public to understand.  The units are unfamiliar
   ("what is a millisecond?") and counterintuitive ("100 msec - that
   sounds good - it's only a tenth of a second!").

   Instead, we create the term "Responsiveness under working conditions"
   to make it clear that we are measuring all, not just idle,
   conditions, and use "round-trips per minute" as the metric.  The
   values range from 50 (poor) to 3,000 (excellent), with the added
   advantage that "bigger is better."  Finally, we abbreviate the
   measurement to "RPM", a wink to the "revolutions per minute" that we
   use for cars.

   This document defines an algorithm for the "RPM Test" that explicitly
   measures responsiveness under working conditions.

2.  Design Constraints

   There are many challenges around measurements on the Internet.  They
   include the dynamic nature of the Internet, the diverse nature of the
   traffic, the large number of devices that affect traffic, and the
   difficulty of attaining appropriate measurement conditions.

   Internet paths are changing all the time.  Daily fluctuations in the
   demand make the bottlenecks ebb and flow.  To minimize the
   variability of routing changes, it's best to keep the test duration
   relatively short.

   TCP and UDP traffic, or traffic on ports 80 and 443, may take
   significantly different paths on the Internet and be subject to
   entirely different Quality of Service (QoS) treatment.  A good test
   will use standard transport layer traffic - typical for people's use
   of the network - that is subject to the transport's congestion
   control that might reduce the traffic's rate and thus its buffering
   in the network.

   Traditionally, one thinks of bufferbloat happening on the routers and
   switches of the Internet.  However, the networking stacks of the
   clients and servers can have huge buffers.  Data sitting in TCP
   sockets or waiting for the application to send or read causes
   artificial latency, and affects user experience the same way as
   "traditional" bufferbloat.

   Finally, it is important to note that queueing only happens behind a
   slow "bottleneck" link in the network, and only occurs when
   sufficient traffic is present.  The RPM Test must ensure that buffers
   are actually full for a sustained period, and only then make repeated
   latency measurements in this particular state.

3.  Goals

   The algorithm described here defines an RPM Test that serves as a
   good proxy for user experience.  This means:

   1.  Today's Internet traffic primarily uses HTTP/2 over TLS.  Thus,
       the algorithm should use that protocol.

       As a side note: other types of traffic are gaining in popularity
       (HTTP/3) and/or are already being used widely (RTP).  Traffic
       prioritization and QoS rules on the Internet may subject traffic
       to completely different paths:



Paasch, et al.            Expires May 30, 2022                  [Page 4]

Internet-Draft   Responsiveness under Working Conditions   November 2021


       these could also be measured separately.

   2.  The Internet is marked by the deployment of countless middleboxes
       like transparent TCP proxies or traffic prioritization for
       certain types of traffic.  The RPM Test must take into account
       their effect on DNS-request [RFC1035], TCP-handshake [RFC0793],
       TLS-handshake, and request/response.

   3.  The test result should be expressed in an intuitive, nontechnical
       form.

   4.  Finally, to be useful to a wide audience, the measurement should
       finish within a short time frame.  Our target is 20 seconds.

4.  Measuring Responsiveness Under Working Conditions

   To make an accurate measurement, the algorithm must reliably put the
   network in a state that represents those "working conditions".  Once
   the network has reached that state, the algorithm can measure its
   responsiveness.  The following explains how the former and the latter
   are achieved.

4.1.  Working Conditions

   For the purpose of this methodology, typical "working conditions"
   represent a state of the network in which the bottleneck node is
   experiencing ingress and egress flows similar to those created by
   humans in the typical day-to-day pattern.

   While a single HTTP transaction might briefly put a network into
   working conditions, making reliable measurements requires maintaining
   the state over sufficient time.

   The algorithm must also detect when the network is in a persistent
   working condition, also called "saturation".

   Desired properties of "working condition":

   o  Should not waste traffic, because the person may be paying for it.

   o  Should finish within a short time to avoid impacting other people
      on the same network, to avoid varying network conditions, and not
      try the person's patience.

4.1.1.  From single-flow to multi-flow

   A single TCP connection may not be sufficient to saturate a path.
   For example, the 4MB constraints on TCP window size constraints may
   not fill the pipe.  Additionally, traditional loss-based TCP
   congestion control algorithms react aggressively to packet loss by
   reducing the congestion window.  This reaction (intended by the
   protocol design) decreases the queueing within the network, making it
   hard to reach saturation.

   The goal of the RPM Test is to keep the network as busy as possible
   in a sustained and persistent way.  It uses multiple TCP connections
   and gradually adds more TCP flows until saturation is reached.

4.1.2.  Parallel vs Sequential Uplink and Downlink

   Poor responsiveness can be caused by queues in either (or both) the
   upstream and the downstream direction.  Furthermore, both paths may
   differ significantly due to access link conditions (e.g., 5G
   downstream and LTE upstream) or the routing changes within the ISPs.
   To measure responsiveness under working conditions, the algorithm
   must saturate both directions.

   Measuring in parallel achieves more data samples for a given
   duration.  Given the desired test duration of 20 seconds, sequential
   uplink and downlink tests would only yield half the data.  The RPM
   Test specifies parallel, concurrent measurements.

   However, a number of caveats come with measuring in parallel:

   o  Half-duplex links may not permit simultaneous uplink and downlink
      traffic.  This means the test might not saturate both directions
      at once.

   o  Debuggability of the results becomes harder: During parallel
      measurement it is impossible to differentiate whether the observed
      latency happens in the uplink or the downlink direction.

   o  Consequently, the test should have an option for sequential
      testing.

4.1.3.  Reaching saturation

   The RPM Test gradually increases the number of TCP connections and
   measures "goodput" - the sum of actual data transferred across all
   connections in a unit of time.  When the goodput stops increasing, it
   means that saturation has been reached.




Paasch, et al.            Expires May 30, 2022                  [Page 6]

Internet-Draft   Responsiveness under Working Conditions   November 2021


   Saturation has two criteria: a) the load bearing connections are
   utilizing all the capacity of the bottleneck, b) the buffers in the
   bottleneck are completely filled.

   The algorithm notes that throughput gradually increases until TCP
   connections complete their TCP slow-start phase.  At that point,
   throughput eventually stalls usually due to receive window
   limitations.  The only means to further increase throughput is by
   adding more TCP connections to the pool of load bearing connections.
   If new connections leave the throughput the same, saturation has been
   reached and - more importantly - the working condition is stable.

   Filling buffers at the bottleneck depends on the congestion control
   deployed on the sender side.  Congestion control algorithms like BBR
   may reach high throughput without causing queueing because the
   bandwidth detection portion of BBR effectively seeks the bottleneck
   capacity.

   RPM Test clients and servers should use loss-based congestion
   controls like Cubic to fill queues reliably.

   The RPM Test detects saturation when the observed goodput is not
   increasing even as connections are being added, or it detects packet
   loss or ECN marks signaling congestion or a full buffer of the
   bottleneck link.

4.1.4.  Final "Working Conditions" Algorithm

   The following algorithm reaches working conditions (saturation) of a
   network by using HTTP/2 upload (POST) or download (GET) requests of
   infinitely large files.  The algorithm is the same for upload and
   download and uses the same term "load bearing connection" for each.

   The steps of the algorithm are:

   o  Create 4 load bearing connections

   o  At each 1 second interval:

      *  Compute "instantaneous aggregate" goodput which is the number
         of bytes transferred within the last second.

      *  Compute a moving average of the last 4 "instantaneous aggregate
         goodput" measurements

      *  If moving average > "previous" moving average + 5%:

Internet-Draft   Responsiveness under Working Conditions   November 2021


         +  Network did not yet reach saturation.  If no flows added
            within the last 4 seconds, add 4 more flows

      *  Else, network reached saturation for the current flow count.

         +  If new flows added and for 4 seconds the moving average
            throughput did not change: network reached stable saturation

         +  Else, add four more flows

   Note: It is tempting to envision an initial base round-trip time
   (RTT) measurement and adjust the intervals as a function of that RTT.
   However, experiments have shown that this makes the saturation
   detection extremely unstable in low RTT environments.  In the
   situation where the "unloaded" RTT is in the single-digit millisecond
   range, yet the network's RTT increases under load to more than a
   hundred milliseconds, the intervals become much too low to accurately
   drive the algorithm.

4.2.  Measuring Responsiveness

   Once the network is in a consistent working conditions, the RPM Test
   must "probe" the network multiple times to measure its
   responsiveness.

   Each RPM Test probe measures:

   1.  The responsiveness of the different steps to create a new
       connection, all during working conditions.

       To do this, the test measures the time needed to make a DNS
       request, establish a TCP connection on port 443, establish a TLS
       context using TLS1.3 [RFC8446], and send and receive a one-byte
       object with a HTTP/2 GET request.  It repeats these steps
       multiple times for accuracy.

   2.  The responsiveness of the network and the client/server
       networking stacks for the load bearing connections themselves.

       To do this, the load bearing connections multiplex an HTTP/2 GET
       request for a one-byte object to get the end-to-end latency on
       the connections that are using the network at full speed.

4.2.1.  Aggregating the Measurements

   The algorithm produces sets of 5 times for each probe, namely: DNS
   handshake, TCP handshake, TLS handshake, HTTP/2 request/response on
   separate (idle) connections, HTTP/2 request/response on load bearing



Paasch, et al.            Expires May 30, 2022                  [Page 8]

Internet-Draft   Responsiveness under Working Conditions   November 2021


   connections.  This fine-grained data is useful, but not necessary for
   creating a useful metric.

   To create a single "Responsiveness" (e.g., RPM) number, this first
   iteration of the algorithm gives an equal weight to each of these
   values.  That is, it sums the five time values for each probe, and
   divides by the total number of probes to compute an average probe
   duration.  The reciprocal of this, normalized to 60 seconds, gives
   the Round-trips Per Minute (RPM).

4.2.2.  Statistical Confidence

   The number of probes necessary for statistical confidence is an open
   question.  One could imagine a computation of the variance and
   confidence interval that would drive the number of measurements and
   balance the accuracy with the speed of the measurement itself.

5.  RPM Test Server API

   The RPM measurement uses standard protocols: no new protocol is
   defined.

   Both the client and the server MUST support HTTP/2 over TLS 1.3.  The
   client MUST be able to send a GET request and a POST.  The server
   MUST be able to respond to both of these HTTP commands.  Further, the
   server endpoint MUST be accessible through a hostname that can be
   resolved through DNS.  The server MUST have the ability to provide
   content upon a GET request.  Both client and server SHOULD use loss-
   based congestion controls like Cubic.  The server MUST use a packet
   scheduling algorithm that minimizes internal queueing to avoid
   affecting the client's measurement.

   The server MUST respond to 4 URLs:

   1.  A "small" URL/response: The server must respond with a status
       code of 200 and 1 byte in the body.  The actual body content is
       irrelevant.

   2.  A "large" URL/response: The server must respond with a status
       code of 200 and a body size of at least 8GB.  The body can be
       bigger, and may need to grow as network speeds increases over
       time.  The actual body content is irrelevant.  The client will
       probably never completely download the object, but will instead
       close the connection after reaching working condition and making
       its measurements.

Internet-Draft   Responsiveness under Working Conditions   November 2021


   3.  An "upload" URL/response: The server must handle a POST request
       with an arbitrary body size.  The server should discard the
       payload.

   4.  A configuration URL that returns a JSON [RFC8259] object with the
       information the client uses to run the test (sample below).
       Sample JSON:



{
  "version": 1,
  "urls": {
    "small_https_download_url": "https://networkquality.example.com/api/v1/small",
    "large_https_download_url": "https://networkquality.example.com/api/v1/large",
    "https_upload_url": "https://networkquality.example.com/api/v1/upload"
  }
}

   The client begins the responsiveness measurement by querying for the
   JSON configuration.  This supplies the URLs for creating the load
   bearing connections in the upstream and downstream direction as well
   as the small object for the latency measurements.
